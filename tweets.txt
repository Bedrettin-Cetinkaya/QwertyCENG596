I binged in a day, I then watched half of season 1 and season 2 again today as the wife hadn't seen it. Such a beautiful TV show, I'd like to see a spin off with Pat and Roxy or something centred on Sandy... she seems to be similar to Tony but has the opposite attitude.
$$$$$0
Reality TV shows that‚Äôs all facts man
$$$$$0
Both excellent 80‚Äôs children TV shows. I was a big fan of Fraggle Rock, which was a little odd as I had (& still have) an aversion to puppetry like on Rainbow and The Muppets (I know they were Jom Henson...)

(in tears) Fiona, Sheryl, Tori, Alanis, Sarah McL, I am so, so sorry I renounced you when Keith said you were "girl music" freshman year

It's #WorldImmunizationWeek Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. #vaccines protect against more than 25 life-threatening diseases, like measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis, influenza, tetanus, typhoid & cervical cancer.
$$$$$2
Vaccination protects us all. During emergencies, risk of disease outbreaks like #measles, #polio, #meningitis increases.Vaccination helps keep us safe and protects our health workers. Ensure you and your family are protected through vaccines.  #VaccinesWork
$$$$$2
Millions of children around the üåç will likely miss out on lifesaving üíâ due to #COVID19.To combat the resurgence of other deadly diseases, we must continue delivering vaccines where we can and ‚¨ÜÔ∏è immunization once this outbreak is under control.
$$$$$2
Investments in the fight against #malaria support the fight against #COVID19 and save lives of the most vulnerable:
pregnant women
children
$$$$$2
This modelling analysis reinforces 
@WHO
‚Äôs call for maintaining essential, life-saving services to prevent, detect & treat #malaria during #COVID19. Countries must use this critical window of opportunity to ensure malaria services are maintained.
$$$$$2
On #WorldMalariaDay, we reiterate our commitment to #EndMalaria, a killer disease that takes a child's life every 2 minutes. Let's unite to combat this disease by making sure that life-saving services are available for all to prevent, detect and treat #malaria.
$$$$$2
Zero #Malaria Starts With Me: Only 1 in 3 pregnant women ü§∞üèø in Africa has access to the WHO-recommended 3 or more doses of preventive malaria therapy.
Let's increase access to preventive therapy to #EndMalaria!
$$$$$2
The toll of #malaria won‚Äôt stop as the #COVID19 pandemic evolves. A stall in action now will bring unnecessary suffering and loss of life
$$$$$2
Investments in the fight against malaria support the fight against #COVID19 and save lives of the most vulnerable: pregnant women 
and children Investments in malaria prevention can help ease the strain on health facilities overburdened by the response to COVID-19.
$$$$$2
Today is #WorldMalariaDay 
#Malaria still kills a child every two minutes. No children should die because they cannot access life-saving services to prevent, detect & treat the disease.
$$$$$2
Vaccines protect us against harmful diseases like polio & measles, by: 
Using our body‚Äôs natural defenses to protect against infections
Training our immune system to create antibodies 
$$$$$2
Our shared commitment is to ensure ALL people have access to ALL the tools to defeat #COVID19.
$$$$$2
I am especially grateful to Sir Andrew Witty and Dr 
@NOIweala
for accepting appointments as Special Envoys for the ACT Accelerator. We are facing a common threat, which we can only defeat with a common approach! #COVID19
$$$$$2
#nurses and #midwives are vaccine champions for parents and parents-to-be.
They provide important first contacts with vaccination services.
$$$$$2
This #WorldImmunizationWeek, we also remember the recent outbreak of #measles and ongoing outbreak of #polio in the Philippines Filipin Bayraƒüƒ±, and how our bayanihan spirit has helped us respond to these threats by leaving no unvaccinated child behind.
$$$$$2
In 2018, 86% of children under the age of five were vaccinated with one dose of the #measles vaccine, up from 72% in 2000 and 20% in 1980.
$$$$$2
Prior to the #COVID19 pandemic, the world had made immense progress in ensuring that children are vaccinated. In 2018, 86% of children under the age of five were vaccinated with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). #VaccinesWork for all!
$$$$$2
We agreed to work together on ensuring equitable access to ventilators globally, prioritizing countries with fragile health systems. We will also collaborate on training #healthworkers on how to use these products to fight #COVID19.
$$$$$2
But even with an expedited process, development of a vaccine for #COVID19 will take time. Precautionary measures are essential now to help keep us safe from disease, including diseases for which vaccines already protect children and adults.
$$$$$2
URGENT: 

Please RT to help us get the attention of 
@realDonaldTrump
 and anyone else who can help

Please, PLEASE allow Sarah to enter the US for potentially life saving cancer treatment
